#Swift study

This is a project to learn the basics of creating an iOS application.  

So far, I have created an interface for uploading a meal picture, labelling it, and rating it.  I have created a table for listing the meals that have been input, and am working on linking that table to the meals that get stored.

After getting stuck on an unexpected error 2/3 of the way through the course, I abandoned the project until I had learned enough to overcome the bug and resume following the instruction.  I took the code school course (which is excellent), and learned enough there to resume this course.  I am now proceeding to completion.
